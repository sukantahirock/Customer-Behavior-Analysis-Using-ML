🧠 Project Title
# Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning

📌 Overview
This project performs customer segmentation based on a marketing campaign dataset using various Machine Learning techniques such as PCA, KMeans, and Agglomerative Clustering.

The goal is to identify meaningful customer groups to enable targeted marketing strategies and personalized product offerings.

**🧰 Tools & Technologies Used**
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- KMeans Clustering
- Agglomerative Clustering
- Label Encoding, Standard Scaling

**🗃️ Dataset**
- Dataset Name: Marketing Campaign Dataset
- Source: [UCI / Provided]
- Format: CSV
- Columns: Age, Income, Education, Marital Status, Campaign Responses, Spending, etc.


**🧪 Steps Performed**
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering (e.g., Age, Family Size, Total Spending)
3. Label Encoding & Standard Scaling
4. Outlier Removal
5. Dimensionality Reduction using PCA
6. Clustering using:
    - KMeans (with Elbow Method)
    - Agglomerative Clustering
7. 3D Cluster Visualization
8. Cluster Profiling and Insights (e.g., Spending vs Income, Campaign Response)


📈 **Key Insights**

- Customers were successfully segmented into 5 distinct groups.
- High-income customers tend to respond less to promotions.
- Families with children have different spending patterns than singles.
- Targeted promotions can be personalized based on cluster characteristics.

**🚀 How to Run**
_1. Clone this repository
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter
3. Run all cells step-by-step
